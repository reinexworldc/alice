# Alice

Alice is a fully customizable, lightweight, and completely terminal-based open-source AI agent for everyday use.
It is designed to stay fast, explicit, and hackable — with no hidden magic and full control in the user’s hands.

## Why Alice?

Most AI tools hide logic behind layers of abstraction. Alice takes the opposite approach.

- Terminal-first: no web UI, no distractions, just your workflow
- Explicit architecture: agent logic is separate from LLM providers
- Fully customizable: prompts, behavior, and controls are yours
- Lightweight by design: minimal dependencies, fast startup
- Hackable: easy to extend, replace, or modify core components

Alice is built for people who want to understand and control their AI tools.
